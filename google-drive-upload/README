Allows one to upload a file to Google Drive using nothing but cURL.

Usage:
	upload.sh <access_token> <file> [title] [path] [mime]

The `path` argument has to be an ID, not a name.
The ID of a folder on Google Drive can be retrieved from its URL.
Always double check your uploads, since corruption may happen.
